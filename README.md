# To-Do List App

## The Odin Project

Complete To-Do list app .... done!

The classic CRUD project! My projects prior to this have focused on incorperating Object Oriented principles into my Javascript code.

This application allowed for the chance to use these principles in a more complex structure. The structure follows an MVC pattern loosely, with Controllers being replaced with Events triggered by ceratin events in the TO-Do list such as opening a New Task Form or an Update Task Form. The app keeps track of the projects between sessions using local storage.
